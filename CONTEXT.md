# ESP NMEA Bridge Context

This context names the NMEA-over-UART and NMEA-over-TCP concepts used by the ESP NMEA bridge app.

## Language

**NMEA frame**:
A single newline-terminated NMEA-0183 message as carried through the bridge after UART framing. It must remain complete; truncating a NMEA frame is invalid because the trailing checksum would no longer describe the carried bytes.
_Avoid_: packet, line, message

**NMEA bridge**:
The in-process fan-out point that accepts NMEA frames from producers and queues them for registered sinks.
_Avoid_: bus, broker, router

**TCP NMEA session**:
One connected TCP socket carrying NMEA frames from the NMEA bridge to a peer until the peer closes or sending fails.
_Avoid_: connection handler, client worker, socket loop

**TCP NMEA server**:
The listener that accepts peers and creates one TCP NMEA session per peer.
_Avoid_: server session

**TCP NMEA client**:
The outbound connector that creates a TCP NMEA session to a configured host or STA gateway.
_Avoid_: upstream session

**NMEA connection state**:
The aggregate availability of active TCP NMEA sessions for carrying NMEA frames. A listening TCP NMEA server without an active session is not connected.
_Avoid_: Wi-Fi state, server state

**NMEA input state**:
The current availability of NMEA frames at the UART input, evaluated over a short time window. The ESP NMEA bridge treats input as active when NMEA bridge accepted-frame counts increase during that window.
_Avoid_: NMEA health, data health, UART health

**NMEA forwarding activity**:
A short-lived occurrence where an NMEA frame is received from UART or successfully sent by a TCP NMEA session.
_Avoid_: packet activity, data event

**Bridge telemetry**:
Observational status about the ESP NMEA bridge, including counters, NMEA input state, NMEA connection state, and warnings for local display or diagnostics. It is not a control plane; modules that change bridge behaviour should use separate control concepts.
_Avoid_: status service, control state, management API

## Example dialogue

Dev: "When the TCP NMEA server accepts a peer, should it publish frames directly?"
Domain expert: "No. The TCP NMEA server only accepts peers. Each accepted peer becomes a TCP NMEA session."
Dev: "Does the TCP NMEA client use a different sender?"
Domain expert: "No. Once connected, it is also a TCP NMEA session carrying NMEA frames from the NMEA bridge."
